I use this in conjunction with a clipboard inserter https://github.com/zanthous/clipboard-inserter plugin. It's not done and only handles some cases. For cases that aren't handled I just use the in-application dictionary for calibre. It also seems to freeze applications I am using currently presumably because of clipboard locking or something but I haven't looked into this yet
